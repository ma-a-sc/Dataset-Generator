What do I need for the generator:
- input from the user as to what the variables should be called.
- input from the user as to what should be the individual obervations set to: int, float, boolean, string, dummy
- input from the user as to in what range the generated values should be (int,float)
- input from the user as to what categories should be the strings
- input from the user as to how many observations should be generated
- input from the user as to how much one variable should depend on another or multiple variables (but not how heavy exaclty the dependencies are, random in a specific range)
- input from the user if there should be missing values, missing at random, completely at random, not missing at random
- option to add more vars or cases later on
